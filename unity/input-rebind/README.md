An example of input rebinding UI which allows player to change default controls can be found at `Prefabs/InputRebindUI`. It's based on the "Rebind UI" sample bundled with the input system package; find more info in the [Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.1/manual/ActionBindings.html#interactive-rebinding).

Be aware, that Naninovel package is not distributed with the project, hence compilation errors will be produced after opening it for the first time; import Naninovel from the Asset Store to resolve the issues.
