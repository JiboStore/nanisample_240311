An example project showing how to set up a custom text printer with right-to-left (Arabic) text support. For more information see: https://naninovel.com/guide/text-printers.html#right-to-left-arabic-text

Be aware, that [Naninovel](https://u3d.as/1pg9) package is not distributed with the project, hence compilation errors will be produced after opening it for the first time; import Naninovel from the Asset Store to resolve the issues.
